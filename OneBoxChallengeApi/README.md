# Onebox challenge REST API

Spring Boot Server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org), you can easily generate a server stub.

The technology used to develop this REST API is Spring Boot version 3.2.2. A in-memory database has been used
to store the carts of the clients. Best practices are employed to ensure code maintainability, as well as the separation between DTO and DAO
, the definition of ControllerAdvice to avoid code repetition when handling exceptions, and the definition of a database access interface decoupled from the current implementation,
meaning that it will be very easy to couple the application
with a new database such as postgresql with the Spring-Jpa libraries.


The underlying library integrating OpenAPI to Spring Boot is [springdoc](https://springdoc.org).
Springdoc will generate an OpenAPI v3 specification based on the generated Controller and Model classes.

To run the application you need to build an image through the commands below:

```
cd ./OneBoxChallengeApi;
docker build -t onebox-api:1.0.0 ;
docker run onebox-api:1.0.0 -p 8080:8080;
```

Once it≈õ running, the specification is available to download using the following url:
http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs/

The application starts the server as a simple java application

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

and test the endpoints.
